# Wine Predictions ML

## Project Overview
This project predicts wine prices using machine learning models trained on the Wine Reviews dataset. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Model comparison and selection
- Visualizations: price distributions, predicted vs actual, residual analysis

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/ppranav03/wine_predictions_ml.git
	```
2. Install dependencies:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. Download the Wine Reviews dataset using KaggleHub (see notebook for details).

## Usage
Open and run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis and predictions. All code and visualizations are included in the notebook.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for all required Python packages.
